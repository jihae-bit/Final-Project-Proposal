## 1 Paragraph Overview

For my final project, I plan to design and code a simple personal artist webpage that represents my creative identity as a singer-songwriter. The page will include my name, short bio, photo, and a music section that embeds my original works. I’ll use HTML and CSS for structure and visual design. My focus is to create a page that matches natural aesthetic of my music. 

## Origniality
My project won't overlap with any of my other class assignments or projects. 

## Good Outcome (Guaranteed)

A single-page site built with HTML and CSS that displays my name, a short introduction, embedded music links from spotify or Youtube. This project will help me practice web fundamentals while also creating something professional and personal.

## Better Outcome (Expected)

A more functional, styled and aesthetically looking good website.

## Ideal Outcome
A fully designed personal artist website including professional layout, smooth transitions, and multiple pages (Home, About, Listen, Contact) that I can use as my real artist webpage.
