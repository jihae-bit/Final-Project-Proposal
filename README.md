## 1 Paragraph Overview

For my final project, I plan to design and code a simple personal artist webpage that represents my creative identity as a singer-songwriter. The page will include my name, short bio, photo, and a “Listen” section that embeds my original works. I’ll use HTML and CSS for structure and visual design. My focus will be on clarity, warmth, and minimalism—using typography and color to reflect the gentle, natural aesthetic of my music. This project will help me practice web fundamentals while also creating something professional and personal.

## Origniality
My project won't overlap with any of my other class assignments or projects. 

## Good Outcome (Guaranteed)

A single-page site built with HTML and CSS that displays my name, a short introduction, embedded music links from spotify or Youtube.

## Better Outcome (Expected)

A functional, styled and aesthetically looking good website.

## Ideal Outcome
A fully designed personal artist website hosted on GitHub Pages or on my personal name link including professional layout, smooth transitions, and multiple pages (Home, About, Listen, Contact) that I can use as my real artist webpage.
